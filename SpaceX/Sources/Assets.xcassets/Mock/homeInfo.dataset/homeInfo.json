The static fire test, held on January 24, was the first time 27 engines were tested together. The launch was a success, and the side boosters landed simultaneously at adjacent ground pads. Drone ship landing of the central core failed due to TEA–TEB chemical igniter running out, preventing two of its engines from restarting; the landing failure caused damage to the nearby drone ship. Final burn to heliocentric Mars–Earth orbit was performed after the second stage and payload cruised for 6 hours through the Van Allen belts. Later, Elon Musk tweeted that the third burn was successful, and JPL's HORIZONS system showed the second stage and payload in an orbit with an aphelion of 1.67 AU. The live webcast proved immensely popular, as it became the second most watched livestream ever on YouTube, reaching over 2.3 million concurrent views.",
